Here we are at the end of our first three weeks at <a href = "gschool.it">gSchool</a>. We’ve been moving at a fast pace and covering a large number of topics so I’m going to give a brief overview of what we’ve done so far, but I’m mostly going to focus on a couple of key things that I have learned.

The first week of school was spent at Galvanize in Denver and we’ve since moved to our regular space on Pearl street in Boulder. We had an great first day full of improv and ice-breaking activities that allowed us to get to know our fellow classmates. I thought that this was key, we have been and will be spending plenty of time learning how to code so getting to know the group that I’d be spending most of my time with for the next 24 weeks was important.

Since the first day, we’ve been coding non-stop. Having only taken some online classes at <a href = "http://www.codecademy.com">Codeacademy</a> and similar sites, I’ve been putting in a lot of time to learn the basics of Ruby, GitHub, testing, the command line, developer workflow, and the way the web works. We just started learning the web framework Sinatra on Thursday, and next week we’ll be tackling our first big project, a URL shortener similar to <a href = "bitly.com">Bit.ly</a>.

Anyways, we’ve done a lot, but here are a few of the biggest lessons that I have learned about coding and about myself:

<ol>

  <li>Testing is awesome. We’ve been starting to practice Test-Drive Development, and while we’re not completely there yet, and won’t be for some time, I can already tell how helpful tests can be. Even though writing tests takes longer, I have found that it really helps me understand the problem at hand and also helps me be better informed about the inevitable bugs that I have to fix.</li>

  <li>Pairing is also awesome. Two of our instructors are from <a href = "http://pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal Labs</a> where everyone pairs all day so pairing is going to play a large role at gSchool, something I am extremely excited about. Working with a pair is great because it keeps you focused and energized, you are able to accomplish things that you wouldn’t be able to alone, and you learn new perspectives and approaches to problems from your pair.</li>

  <li>The most important skill that I brought to gSchool was how to approach essay prompts, something I learned in 10th grade AP US History. In that class, I learned how to bucket my response into different categories such as economic, social, political, or foreign policy, and that strategy of breaking down problems has been invaluable. I have been able to translate this into coding by being able to turn stories into smaller and more manageable mini stories. For example, if we have a problem that asks us to “take a string and sort it alphabetically by word”, I can turn that into several steps: 1. Split up the string by word, 2. Create an array of the words, 3. Sort the array alphabetically. Now, we have a three-step problem with individual components that can be understood more easily. I’ve found that with the problems I’ve had more trouble with, I didn’t successfully turn them into smaller problems and became overwhelmed.</li>

  <li>>The local tech community (and in particular the Ruby community) is incredible. While we’ve been spending a lot of our time in the classroom, we have already had the opportunity to make some amazing connections. We’ve gone to Ruby meetups in Denver and Boulder, had a guest speaker the first week, have more speakers lined up, and have had the opportunity to meet people from companies that are doing amazing things at happy hours. This past week we met a couple of people from <a href = "occipital.com">Occiptal</a> and saw a demo of their 3D mapping technology, and next week we’re going to have some afternoon work space at <a href = "techstars.com">Techstars</a>, a large startup accelerator. Everyone in the community has been very supportive of all of us newbies and due to the current shortage of programmers, want to hear more about how gSchool and similar programs are bringing in people from other industries.</li>

</ol>

As a last thought, here’s a photo from @JennyAllar with a couple of us gSchoolers enjoying the Flatirons during lunch.
