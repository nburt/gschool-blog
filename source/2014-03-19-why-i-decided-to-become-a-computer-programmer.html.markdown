From an early age I have been obsessed with languages. My mom is a French professor at the University of California, Irvine so I grew up taking French classes with her, going to France most summers, and even living in Paris for a year in 8th grade.

Upon returning to the U.S., I continued to take French in high school and decided to pursue a Bachelor’s in Romance Languages at Colorado College. Through a class in translation my junior year I fell in love with translation, and in particular, literary texts. I loved researching cultural differences and coming to understand them, as well as coming up with creative ways to translate metaphors that would be understood by native French speakers. Due to that first class, I chose to translate Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 into French for my senior thesis to pursue that passion.

Following college I landed a job at a translation company in Aurora, CO where I learned an incredible amount about translation as well as a number of things outside of translation including desktop publishing, managing websites, and digital marketing.

Around September of last year I took a step back to reflect on my job and I discovered that there was a common theme among everything that I truly enjoyed doing. Whether it was translating a document, adding content to our website, or designing an ebook, landing pages, and calls-to-action, I was creating something. What I loved about my job was being able to finish something and directly see the impact of my work.

I began thinking long and hard about where I was and realized that while I loved translation, I didn’t want to remain in the industry for the long-haul. There were several reasons for this:
	<ul>
	  <li> There is not much demand for literary translation, which is what I enjoy most </li>
	  <li> Working at a company would mean that I would have responsibilities outside of translation </li>
	  <li> If I wanted to work as a full-time translator, I would likely have to become a freelancer (the majority of today’s professional translators are) </li>
  </ul>

Knowing these things I began exploring other industries based on what I had come to realize I enjoyed most about my job, creating. After speaking with a friend who is a web developer, and first hearing about gSchool, I began taking some online classes to see if I would be interested in coding.

I quickly found that I loved it. Coding challenged me, allowed me to be creative, and I was able to see tangible results from the work that I put in. I was having a great time, but I knew that it would be difficult for me to learn while still working from 9 to 5 every weekday. I would need to commit to learning full-time.

It was at that point that I began to seriously look into gSchool and other schools like it. When I was accepted to gSchool mid-December, I immediately jumped at the opportunity.

I’m positive that I made the right decision. I’m surrounded by incredible people and I have learned more in the past two and a half weeks than I had in the previous five plus months of self study. I’m really looking forward to the next 5 months and can’t wait to keep learning.
